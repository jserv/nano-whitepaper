\IEEEPARstart{S}{ince} the implementation of Bitcoin in 2009, there has been a growing shift away from traditional, government-backed currencies and financial systems towards modern payments systems based on cryptography, which offer the ability to store and transfer funds in a trustless and secure manner \cite{Nakamoto_bitcoin:a}. In order to function effectively, a currency must be easily transferable, non-reversible, and have limited or no fees. The increased transaction times, large fees, and questionable network scalability have raised questions about the practicality of Bitcoin as an everyday currency.

In this paper, we introduce RaiBlocks, a low-latency cryptocurrency built on an innovative block-lattice data structure offering unlimited scalability and no transaction fees. RaiBlocks by design is a simple protocol with the sole purpose of being a high-performance cryptocurrency. The RaiBlocks protocol can run on low-power hardware, allowing it to be a practical, decentralized cryptocurrency for everyday use.
