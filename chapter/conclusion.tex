In this paper we presented the framework for a trustless, feeless, low-latency cryptocurrency that utilizes a novel block-lattice structure and delegated Proof of Stake voting. The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput. All of this is achieved by having individual blockchains for each account, eliminating access issues and inefficiencies of a global data-structure. We identified possible attack vectors on the system and presented arguments on how RaiBlocks is resistant to these forms of attacks.
