\title{RaiBlocks: A Feeless Distributed Cryptocurrency Network}

% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
\author{Colin LeMahieu\\clemahieu@gmail.com}% <-this % stops a space


% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those ''LaTeX things''. For
% instance, ''\textbf{A} \textbf{B}'' will typeset as ''A B'' not ''AB''. To get
% ''AB'' then you have to do: ''\textbf{A}\textbf{B}''
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

% \begin{abstract}
% While distributed cryptocurrencies have been around for several years, adoption has been low and initial adopter markets have failed to materialize.

% Compared to a centralized system, the transaction performance of these systems are significantly worse, relegating them to niche markets that primarily capitalize on the benefits of decentralization at the cost of speed or expense. RaiBlocks is designed to solve performance and cost problems while retaining properties of currency and decentralization.

% Our approach uses two high level observations: run-time agreements are slower than design time agreements and complexity only increases agreement time rather than lowering it.
% \end{abstract}

\begin{abstract}
    Recently, high demand and limited scalability have increased the average transaction times and fees in popular cryptocurrencies, yielding an unsatisfactory experience. Here we introduce RaiBlocks, a cryptocurrency with a novel block-lattice architecture where each account has its own blockchain, delivering near instantaneous transaction speed and unlimited scalability. Each user has their own blockchain, allowing them to update it asynchronously to the rest of the network, resulting in fast transactions with minimal overhead. Transactions keep track of account balances rather than transaction amounts, allowing aggressive database pruning without compromising security. To date, the RaiBlocks network has processed 4.2 million transactions with an unpruned ledger size of only 1.7GB. RaiBlock's feeless, split-second transactions make it the premier cryptocurrency for consumer transactions.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent

% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)

% \begin{IEEEbiography}{Colin LeMahieu}
% Biography text here.
% \end{IEEEbiography}

% if you will not have a photo at all:
% \begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
